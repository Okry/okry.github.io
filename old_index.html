                Hello, my name is Alex Okros. I am currently a senior in Computer Science in Engineering at the University of Michigan expecting to complete my Bachelor's degree this May. Much of my coursework has a focus on video game development and user experience with the rest of my courses giving me a strong breadth of knowledge in the software development fields.

                From January 14th to April 22nd, I will be working on Project-Orpheus, a research project meant to make it easier for new game developers to create music for their game before investing in a composer. In this blog I will be posting weekly updates to my research as the semester progresses.

                For my Major Design Experience project as a senior in Computer Science Engineering, I, along with three other team members made a game called "Party Poopers". For this project, we worked hard to develop a game for the University of Michigan Video Game Showcase over six weeks using an iterative design process. This process involved doing weekly sprints using the project management website <a href="https://hacknplan.com">hacknplan</a> followed by getting user feedback at the end of the week which we used to make meaningful changes to our game. My main role for this project was developing the HUD (Heads up display) user interface, tutorial design, character modeling/animation, and audio development. During this period, I learned strong project management skills along with a much better understanding of user guidance.

                Those who wish to play the game can download it for free using the link above. The game requires 4 players with controllers and is designed for 4 monitors due to the nature of the showcase. Xbox controllers recommended, but not required.

                Muttnik was a project I worked on with three others for the 2018 WolverineSoft October Game Jam. For the Jam, we had 48 hours to create a video game following a theme given at the beginning of the Jam. The theme was Fall and the games were judged on the criteria: mechanics, art, audio, and theme compliance. Our game won first in mechanics, second in audio, third on theme, and second place overall out of approximately 30 other teams. My main tasks during this was object pooling, parrallax, and sound effects.
